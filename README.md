# getting-and-cleaning-data

This is the read me file for the 3rd JHU Coursera Data Science Certification class - Getting and Cleaning Data

This reposity contains two files meant to support each other

1.  A Codebook that explains the data set and the methods used in the analysis file 
2.  An R Script that takes the data set and turns it into a tidy data set of data of interest, and aggregrates data of interest for further tidy shariing
